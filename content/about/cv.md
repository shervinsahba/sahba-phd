**summary**: I'm a photonics and ML researcher with a Physics PhD and Applied Math MS from the University of Washington. I previously worked as a classroom instructor and tutor, and in the distant past, I had worked in logistics and event management. Nowadays I look forward to software development, AI research, and both video and tabletop game content generation.

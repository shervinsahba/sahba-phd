I'm a **physicist and machine learning researcher**. I finished my PhD in Physics at the University of Washington this year, and [my fianc√©e gave me this sword](https://twitter.com/thecreepingmoon/status/1712183765920075812) as congratulations. That's how I know it was all worthwhile. Check out the links at the top of the page or head to my [Research](/research).

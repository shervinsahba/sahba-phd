I developed this website using the [hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/). It's reminiscent of Jekyll, which you may be familiar with if you made a Github page in the last five years, but instead of written in Ruby, it's written in Go. Hugo seems to be friendlier and faster to me than Jekyll, so I'll be sticking with this layout for the foreseeable future.

That being said, after grabbing a theme and setting up the framework, I'm mainly editting Markdown and making CSS/HTML tweaks.

If you're looking to make a blog, it's worth setting up a framework that leverages Markdown. It's easy to learn, write, and maintain. Having your blog posts sitting in human readable text files is enormously powerful (as an aside, this is why I adore the note-taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)). 

# Theming

The theming is based off the lovely [monochrome theme](go.io/themes/hugo-theme-monochrome/) by You-Kai Zheng, and I've added some of my own CSS, icons, and shortcodes. Icon glyphs have been taken from [feathericons](https://feathericons.com/) and [academicons](https://github.com/jpswalsh/academicons). The original theme just used a couple feather icons, but I added more. Personally, I'm more used to Nerd Fonts glyphs, which I use extensively on my Linux theming, so I might switch to those in the future.

# Source code

You can grab the code for this page [on github](https://github.com/shervinsahba/hugo-sherv). As always, it's a work in progress.

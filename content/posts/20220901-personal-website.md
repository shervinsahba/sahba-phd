I developed this website using the [hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo is reminiscent of Jekyll, which you may be familiar with if you made a Github page in the last five years. While Jekyll is written in Ruby, Hugo is written in Go. Hugo seems to be friendlier and faster to me than Jekyll, so I'll be sticking with this layout for the foreseeable future.

After grabbing a theme and setting up the framework, I'm mainly editting Markdown and making CSS/HTML tweaks. If you're looking to make a blog or static site, it's worth taking a look at Hugo. Chiefly, the content almost all leverages Markdown. That makes it easy to learn, write, and maintain. Having your blog posts sitting in human readable text files is enormously powerful (as an aside, this is why I adore the note-taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)). 

# Theming

The theming is based off the lovely [monochrome theme by kaiiiz](https://kaiiiz.github.io/hugo-theme-monochrome/), and I've added some of my own CSS, icons, and shortcodes. Icon glyphs have been taken from [feathericons](https://feathericons.com/) and [academicons](https://github.com/jpswalsh/academicons). I'm more used to Nerd Fonts glyphs, which I use extensively on my Linux theming, so I might switch to those in the future.

# Source code

You can grab the code for this page [on github](https://github.com/shervinsahba/sahba-phd). As always, it's a work in progress.
